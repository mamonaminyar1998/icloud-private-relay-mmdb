This project provides an auto-generated iCloud Private Relay egress IP ranges in MMDB format built from the [official feed](https://mask-api.icloud.com/egress-ip-ranges.csv) provided by Apple.

The source feed is checked daily for updates, and a new version is automatically generated in case of any changes.
